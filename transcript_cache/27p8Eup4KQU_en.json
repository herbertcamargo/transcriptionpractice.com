{"transcript": "hey guys Tony here so I wanted to record a video a response video to will Humphrey's video that he shared yesterday I'll post a link down below to his video just so that you guys can go check it out it's a great impassion plea to try and motivate clinicians to start taking action and focus on the true priorities I agree with pretty much everything that Will's sharing you know I agree that the profession is frustrated it is angered it needs to do something different like it is on a steady decline um I agree that we need to understand the importance of profitability profitability is what makes us that gives us a platform to do what we love to do I don't necessarily agree with the idea that we have to fight insurance companies we have to Lobby Congress we have to do a lot of the things that have always been done because I think those strategies have been proven ineffective you know and and while I could get into a deep conversation about insurance uh I just don't think that moves the needle in any significant way I think my solution to you as a therapist being overworked and underpaid is to find a better business model you know for for a long time before 1900 ice harvesting was a massive industry it was one of the world's largest most profitable interest Industries but when Refrigeration came along ice harvesting disappeared and so we need to innovate our way out of this situation we can't just think that we can fight for higher reimbursement and we can Lobby Congress to pay us more that money has got to come from somewhere and it's not going to come from insurance and Congress so I would say more important yes we need to take action yes we need to do something yes we need to figure out how to dig ourselves out of this hole because like will said most of you are just too busy to affect change you're too busy keeping up with your progress notes and your documentation you're too busy checking your schedule for the rest of the week and figuring out how you're going to get all of these patients in keeping up with the productivity standards that somebody else is setting for you like I I'm not blaming you for not doing something I'm just recognizing the fact that our best opportunity to save the profession isn't going to be fighting insurance companies and lobbying com Congress our best opportunity to save the profession is to innovate our way out of the situation to do what we do best as physical therapists we were amazing problem solvers some of the best problem solvers in the world and so we need to look at look at the problem for what it is you have a high level of expertise you have a high level of knowledge you have a high level of clinical skill you can't afford to trade time for money in the current model so how can we make it so that we increase profitability without the associated increase in productivity you know where can we look and of course if you guys know anything about me if you've seen any of my videos on the channel you know I'm a huge proponent of finding ways to monetize our time our knowledge our value in ways that don't involve selling time selling minutes of your life so whether that be video content whether that be social media whether that be creating courses um you know any of the the number of ways that really are available to you in 2022 that weren't available in 2000 or in 1980 or in 1970 uh we're still trying to force a business model that was successful 30 40 50 years ago into an economy that is completely different let's take some time let's step back let's take a breather let's innovate our business model let's find new ways to provide greater access to a larger Community a larger population who would benefit from our services at a lower cost and in the process figure out new monetization strategies for what it is that we do so will first thank you so much for sharing your video and starting the conversation you guys who are watching this we'd love to hear from you I'm sure will would love to see a thousand comments below his video go to his video comment on his video let us know what you're thinking and if you find a way to start to innovate I know there's a lot of amazing clinicians out there who are innovating we just don't know about you share your message let us know I'll catch you guys on the next video", "timestamps": [0.659, 0.659,
