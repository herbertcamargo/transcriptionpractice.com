From ABC News, this is ABC World News Tonight with David Mure reporting tonight from the Vatican. And good evening tonight from the Vatican where we are just hours away from the funeral for Pope Francis. The final preparations now underway right here behind me tonight. Just a short time ago, a solemn moving moment inside St. Peter's Basilica. The public vigil for Pope Francis is now over. The Pope's coffin has now been closed as part of an ancient private ritual. Tens of thousands are expected right here at St. Peter Square in just hours. They're also expected to line the streets of Rome here. For the last 3 days, some 250,000 people came to St. Peter's Basilica to offer a prayer, a final farewell in person. People from all over the world coming to see the People's Pope. I spoke with Americans who were among the last ones allowed into the Basilica late today to pay their respects. And you'll hear what moved them most. They're from Texas to Ohio to Florida and why they came to Rome. Then the gates were pulled shut and the final visitors finished filing through. Inside, Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, a former Dallas bishop, presiding over the ceremony. The Pope's face was covered with a white cloth. Inside, a metal tube, they placed a document summarizing the Pope's deeds and other symbols of his time as the head of the Catholic Church. And then a wooden top was placed over that simple wooden coffin Pope Francis had asked for, and it was nailed shut. Priests will stand vigil by Pope Francis overnight until his funeral tomorrow morning. The mass begins at 10 a.m. local time right here at the Vatican. We'll be on the air starting at 3:30 in the morning tomorrow morning. Of course, we hope you'll get up early with us for the funeral and the procession right through Rome to his final resting place. But tonight here, the extraordinary moments late today. And ABC's Terry Moran was right here in St. Peter Square. Late today, in the final few hours to say goodbye to Pope Francis, the crowds in St. Peter Square swelled in one last wave as 3 days of public viewing came to a close. All told, 250,000 people from all corners of the earth came here to pay their respects. Then the great doors to the basilica were closed and a solemn ceremony began. The right of the closing of the coffin. A white cloth placed gently over the pope's face. A deed recounting the accomplishments of Francis's papacy put in a metal tube in his coffin. and Cardinal Kevin Ferrell, a former Dallas bishop and now the Camelarang or Chamberlain of the Vatican, blessing the body with holy water. The coffin was sealed, then nailed shut. Several members of Francis's family were there. Priests will say prayers and a vigil by the body all night. Now the square is empty, the crowds are gone, and a hush, a sense of anticipation almost has settled over everything. Over here, that's the world's press. They're getting ready and the long avenue awaits the hundreds of thousands who are expected to attend the funeral. Francis inspired many men and women to serve in the church. We met Sister Bernardet Sto from Michigan. And Pope Francis really um he really had a heart of mercy and uh he personally touched me in my religious life. She said before she became a nun, she was in a crisis in her life. The pope's emphasis on mercy helped her get through it and find her vocation. So when you got up there with all this and you saw him Yeah. What do you think? I don't know. So many emotions. There's so many emotions going here. Like you're sad, you're happy, you're you feel all these type of emotions. And um that's how I was feeling. Sad. I was feeling happy. Tonight, hundreds of world leaders are converging on Rome. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump asked how they would remember Francis before departing for the funeral. Very well. Good man. He loved uh he loved the world actually and he was just just a good man. I met him twice. Uh I thought he was a fantastic kind of a guy. After the funeral, the slow drive more than 3 miles through the streets of Rome, allowing thousands more to say farewell. The route will start at St. Peters, cross the Tyber River, then pass major landmarks like the Piaza Venitzia and the Colosseum before ending at Francis's final resting place, St. Mary Major Basilica. a special place for him. This image shows what his marble tomb will look like inside that 1,500year-old church. He asked the tomb should be simple. Only one inscription, Franciscus. And once Francis is laid to rest, the world's attention will turn to that secret ancient ritual of choosing the next pope, the conclave. The cardinals meeting again today, discussing the future of the church. There are a lot of candidates being mentioned. The old saying is if you go into the conclave paple or like a pope you come out a cardinal. So the Holy Spirit tends to surprise us. There are always surprises from the conclave. Let's bring Terry Moran back in with us tonight and just outside the Vatican where Terry is standing by. And as we know, Pope Francis's funeral now just hours away here. Terry, it'll be held outside right there in St. Peter Square. And while it's a mass for a pope, uh it's not unlike what you would see at a typical Catholic funeral for anyone. That's very true, David. And uh not only a typical Catholic funeral, but an ordinary Catholic mass at the heart of this funeral is a mass so familiar to so many Catholics. And it'll be right out in the open for hundreds of thousands to join in the celebration of the mass and of the life of this remarkable man. David, Terry, we'll see you just a few hours from now. Terry, thank you. Terry will be here with me along with James Longman, Deborah Roberts, and our entire team for Pope Francis's funeral tomorrow morning. ABC News live coverage of the funeral begins at 3:30 a.m. Eastern tomorrow morning. We'll see you bright and early for what will be a very moving day here. And then later here tonight, the Americans who were among the last ones in to pay their respects late today and what they told me when they came out, what moved them and why they came all this way to the Vatican. But we do move on to the other news this Friday night. The Trump administration signaling a major escalation in its deportation efforts. The FBI arresting an American judge, accusing her of helping an undocumented migrant in her courtroom evade authorities. They say she helped the migrant get out the door. Here's Pier Thomas tonight. Tonight, a sitting state court judge is facing federal charges and possibly years in prison and what critics are saying is a major escalation in the Trump administration's effort to pressure officials to assist in deportation effort. Judge Anything to say about this? Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan seen here leaving court after being arrested by the FBI. Dugan faces multiple charges for allegedly obstructing ICE agents trying to arrest an undocumented immigrant. According to a newly unsealed indictment on April 18th, Dugan was visibly upset and had a confrontational angry demeanor when she and another judge confronted a group of federal agents that had come to her courthouse to arrest Eduardo Flores Ruez, an undocumented Mexican citizen who was in court to face misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Agents said she told them to go to see the chief judge of the courthouse and went back to her courtroom where Judge Jugan then escorted Flores Ruez and his counsel out of the courtroom through a jury door. If you commit a crime in this country, you're going to be held accountable. Doesn't matter. We're going to prosecute you. No one is above the law, not even a judge. No justice. Dugan's attorney saying in court she wholeheartedly protests the arrest and believes it was not made in the interest of public safety. Overnight, another judicial related arrest in Los Cusus, New Mexico. The FBI taking former county magistrate Joel Cano and his wife Nancy into custody. Held without bond, accused of harboring three Venezuelan gang members on their property. David, it's extremely rare for a judge to be charged with obstructing an immigration case. That Wisconsin judge is vowing to fight the charges, but David, if convicted, she faces up to 6 years in prison. Pierre Thomas live in Washington tonight. Pierre, thank you. Now to President Trump's tariffs and what he said late today about his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods coming into the US. And tonight, the president telling Time magazine he would not call President Xi first, but indicated President Xi has reached out to him. And President Trump now claiming to have made 200 trade deals already, but the White House providing no proof. Here's Mary Bruce. Tonight, President Trump declaring he will not roll back his staggering 145% tariffs on all Chinese products entering the US unless China agrees to substantial concessions. Well, I'm not going to drop them unless they give us something that's, you know, substantial. Otherwise, I'm not going to drop them. But it's not clear what concessions would be enough. And at this point, it's also unclear whether the US and China are even negotiating. The president insists they are, telling Time magazine in a new interview that Chinese President Xi Jinping personally reached out to him. Trump said that after Time asked if he would be willing to make the first call. Will you call President Xi if he doesn't call you? They asked. No, Trump said you won't. Nope. Time then asking, has he called you yet? Yep. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf. This though, China insists, quote, \"China and the United States have not consulted or negotiated on the tariff issue. The United States should not confuse the public.\" Today, ABC's Rachel Scott asking the president, \"You said that you have spoken to President Xi. When did that happen? China says it hasn't happened. I spoke to him numerous times. But Trump pressed. When did those calls happen? Were they after Trump put in place his tariffs on China? Have you spoken to him since the tariffs? When did he last? I don't want to I don't want to comment on that, but I've spoken to him many times. Trump is eager to prove his trade policies are paying off. He told Time magazine he has already made 200 deals, though he wouldn't say what they were or which countries are involved. But the bottom line, the White House has not announced a single deal yet. And this all comes as the president is now preparing to mark his first 100 days in office. Our new ABC News Washington Post Ipso's poll showing just 34% approve of his handling of tariffs with 64% disapproving and seven in 10 Americans say Trump's tariffs will drive up inflation. David, Mary Bruce live at the White House on a Friday night for us. Mary, thank you. Next tonight here, uh, CEO murder suspect Luigi Manion pleading not guilty to federal charges in the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Midtown Manhattan Street. Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty. Then at the end of the hearing, Manion's attorney saying prosecutors had inadvertently eavesdropped on one of Manion's calls with his legal team from jail. The judge now demanding an explanation on that by next Friday. Now to Boston to another case making national headlines and tonight, a dramatic turn. Jurors in the Karen Reed murder trial were taken to the scene where her Boston police officer boyfriend was found. Her defense team claims she was framed. Matt Gutman on this again tonight. Tonight, the jury in the Karen Reed trial visiting the home where her one-time boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keeffe, was found outside unconscious in a blizzard in January 2022. The jurors were busted to the scene, a modest house in the Boston suburb of Canton, seeing that Lexus SUV that prosecutors say Karen Reed used to hit John O'keefe following a night of drinking. The back tail light now missing. They then headed back to the courtroom for a fourth day, hearing testimony from one of the paramedics who treated Reed. Did she make any statements to you when you were giving her treatment or speaking to her about her husband? last conversation she had with her husband at the time was an argument. Um, I didn't feel like it was my role to really find out the details on what was said. Did she tell you what the argument was about? She did not. And David, that case has become a local obsession. That little house in Canton has become one of the most famous in all of Massachusetts. Now, Reed claims that she was framed in a police cover up and that trial resumes on Monday. David, Matt Gubman covering the case for us. Matt, thank you. When we come back tonight, several wildfires breaking out in the Northeast. You'll see the firefighters driving through the flames and the storms we're tracking in multiple states tonight. Also ahead, she the new images just in tonight, the police video showing the wife of the basist from the band Weezer in a shootout with officers. And what police say this video now reveals in a moment. Tonight, the LAPD releasing dramatic body camera video showing the moment officer shot the wife of the basist from the band Weezer. Police say Jillian Shriner can be seen with a gun in her backyard shooting at officers who were actually searching for suspects in an unrelated matter. Officers firing from behind a fence. Police say the video shows her pointing and shooting her gun at them. She was hit in the shoulder and arrested. She's due back in court next week. When we come back here tonight, the wildfires in the Northeast and storms across several states we're tracking tonight and the surprise of the NFL draft live right here on ABC. To the index of other news, two wildfires in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. The fires burning across more than 1,000 acres in the show State Forest. The Jones Road Fire in Ocean County, New Jersey, now 60% contained. A system bringing rain into the Northeast tomorrow could help Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York, Boston with those conditions. Night two of the NFL draft just minutes away right here on ABC. Miami Hurricanes quarterback Cam Ward going first in the draft to the Tennessee Titans. Hall of Famer Warren Moon surprising him by unretiring his number one Titans jersey so Cam Ward can now wear it. Tonight, all eyes on Colorado quarterback Shadur Sanders, son of Dion Sanders, of course, who went undrafted in the first round. When we come back here tonight, the Americans I met right here in St. Peter Square today. They had just bid farewell to Pope Francis. What moved them most and why they came all this way? Finally tonight here, the Americans who wanted to be here for Pope Francis. As the sun sets on St. Peter Square, we walk toward the Basilica. It is right here outside in the square tomorrow, the funeral where tens of thousands will bid farewell to Pope Francis. And at the edges of the square tonight, quiet prayer. Here in St. Peter Square, you can actually see it's far more quiet. uh very subdued now after tens of thousands waited in line here to pay their respects to Pope Francis. Uh the final group of people actually allowed in are now streaming out before they close off the square uh to prepare for tomorrow morning's funeral. And among those coming out, a number of Americans who thought it was really important that they pay their respects to Pope Francis, too. We met Teshara Antoine from Miami, Florida. She's getting her masters in London, but she felt it was important to be right here. What was it about Pope Francis? I thought he embodied humility very well. Even the way that he approached being a pope, he wanted to be with the people all the time. He didn't continue some of the traditions that the former popes would do. Like he wanted to have more open, I guess, an openness with the public and I thought that was beautiful. And more accessibility. Exactly. More accessibility. After paying their respects inside the basilica, there was Elena Raina from Texas and Landry McBicker from Akran, Ohio, too. One of his final wishes was to be in a simple coffin and at that level, not to be elevated, but to be down on the ground so that people could see him. Mhm. What do you make of that? I think it just speaks to the kind of pope he was really a pope of the people. And it was wonderful that we got to see him. You know, the port is coffin is closed. So, it was nice. What was it about Pope Francis that allowed him to reach beyond the Catholic Church? It's easy when your goal is to love everyone and to love wholeheartedly. I think that he just loved people. And Liliana and Samir from Texas, marking their 27th wedding anniversary today, and they were among the final mourers allowed in. Were you able to get inside to pay your respects? Yes. After a lot of hours doing the land, Yes. You waited for hours? Yes. Yeah. But it's worth it. I mean, we pay the respect to the Pope. We we familywise, we pray a lot with him. We love him. This is your 27th wedding anniversary. Yes. And how moving was it to mark this day saying farewell to the Pope? Pope Francis all the time he expressed love and our marriage is based on love. I think that's why it's important for us to pay the respect for him. their 27th wedding anniversary. They said it was only appropriate because to them, Pope Francis was love. I'll see you at 3:30 in the morning right here on ABC from the Vatican. Good night.
