THE PENTAGON TONIGHT SAYING IT WILL MARK THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. ARMY. AND IT WILL COINCIDE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 79TH BIRTHDAY. AND NEWS OF THIS MILITARY CELEBRATION COMES AMID THE PRESIDENT'S PROPOSED BUDGET THAT INVOLVES DEEP CUTS TONIGHT TO THE CDC, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, EDUCATION AND CLIMATE. MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY ARE SOUNDING THE ALARM TONIGHT OVER THE LEVEL OF MILITARY SPENDING. HERE'S MARY BRUCE. >> TONIGHT, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANNING A MASSIVE MILITARY CELEBRATION THROUGH THE STREETS OF WASHINGTON, D.C, TO MARK THE ARMY'S 250TH ANNIVERSARY, COINCIDING WITH THE PRESIDENT'S 79TH BIRTHDAY. TONIGHT, THE MILITARY SAYS THE ARMY IS EXPLORING OPTIONS TO MAKE THE CELEBRATION EVEN BIGGER. THE JUNE 14TH PARADE COULD INVOLVE NEARLY 7000 SOLDIERS, TANKS AND INFANTRY VEHICLES, HELICOPTER FLYOVERS AND EVEN PARACHUTE JUMPERS. HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST? UNCLEAR. NEWS OF THE POSSIBLE PARADE COMES AS THE PRESIDENT IS PROPOSING HISTORIC CUTS TO DOMESTIC SPENDING. $163 BILLION ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK TRUMP'S $1.7 TRILLION BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR NEXT YEAR, SLASHING HALF OF THE CDC BUDGET FROM $9 BILLION DOWN TO $4 BILLION, INCLUDING ELIMINATING THE OFFICE THAT WORKS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND DRUG OVERDOSES. EDUCATION FUNDING CUT BY $12 BILLION, INCLUDING PROGRAMS THAT HELP HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS. ENERGY PROGRAMS ALSO GUTTED, INCLUDING AN INITIATIVE TO HELP LOW INCOME AMERICANS PAY FOR THEIR ENERGY BILLS.

WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS HOPING TO BOOST BORDER SECURITY AND DEFENSE SPENDING. THE WHITE HOUSE TOUTING A 13% INCREASE IN MILITARY SPENDING, BRINGING THE DEFENSE BUDGET TO OVER $1 TRILLION. BUT TONIGHT, HAWKISH REPUBLICANS SAY IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. THE TOP REPUBLICAN ON THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, MIKE ROGERS, SAYING HE'S VERY CONCERNED THE REQUESTED BASE BUDGET FOR DEFENSE DOES NOT REFLECT A REALISTIC PATH TO BUILDING THE MILITARY CAPABILITY WE NEED TO ACHIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH AGENDA. BUT DESPITE THOSE CUTS AND THE ECONOMIC TURMOIL, THE ADMINISTRATION STILL HOPING TO RAMP UP THE ARMY'S ANNIVERSARY WITH THAT LAVISH PARADE. NOW, THERE WERE ALWAYS PLANS TO MARK THE ARMY'S MILESTONE, BUT THE DECISION TO ADD ON THIS PARADE, AND THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENS TO COINCIDE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S BIRTHDAY, IS SPARKING SPECULATION AND RECALL. TRUMP TRIED TO THROW A SIMILAR GRAND PARADE DURING HIS FIRST TERM, BUT IT WAS SCRAPPED WHEN ESTIMATES TOPPED $90 MILLION. AND ALL THIS NEWS COMING ON THE SAME DAY THAT THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET CUTS WERE PROPOSED. DAVID. >> MARY BRUCE LIVE AT THE WHITE HOUSE ON A FRIDAY NIGHT MARY. THANK YOU.

HARRY, DEVASTATED AT LOSING HIS LEGAL APPEAL TODAY, CLAIMING HIS FATHER COULD EASILY CHANGE IT. >> I THOUGHT WITH ALL THE DISAGREEMENTS AND ALL OF THE CHAOS THAT'S HAPPENING, THE ONE THING THAT I COULD RELY ON IS MY FAMILY KEEPING ME SAFE. AND NOT ONLY DID THEY DECIDE TO REMOVE MY SECURITY IN THE UK, BUT THEY ALSO SIGNALED TO EVERY SINGLE GOVERNMENT AROUND THE WORLD NOT TO PROTECT US. >> HARRY, WHO'S FIFTH IN LINE TO THE THRONE, HASN'T BROUGHT PRINCE ARCHIE AND PRINCESS LILIBET KING CHARLES GRANDCHILDREN TO THE UK SINCE 2022. HE SECURITY DOWNGRADED IN 2020 WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE, MEGHAN, STEPPED DOWN FROM THEIR OFFICIAL ROLES AND LEFT THE COUNTRY.
