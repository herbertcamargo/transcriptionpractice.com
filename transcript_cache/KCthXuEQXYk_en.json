{"transcript": "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Well, tonight's not the night that we wanted for the Liberal Party or for our coalition or indeed for our country. But we've worked hard every day over the course of the last three years to do our best for our amazing country. One of the great honors of being the leader of this party is that we have met people from every side, every corner, the length and breadth of this country. And there are many amazing stories, people who have sacrificed, people who are doing it hard at the moment. and I've always wanted in public life for the best for our country and the best for every Australian. The highlight of my career has been as the defense minister and over the course of this campaign on Anzac Day, we caught up with young veterans in Townsville at the RSL and it reminded me of how lucky we are as a country and I want to acknowledge all of those men and women in uniform who keep us safe as a country. Now, we didn't do well enough during this campaign. That much is obvious tonight and I accept full responsibility for that. Earlier on, I called the prime minister to congratulate him on his success tonight. It's an historic occasion for the Labour Party and we recognize that. I congratulated the prime minister and wished he and Jody and Nathan all the very best. And I said to the prime minister that his mom would be incredibly proud of his achievement tonight and he should be very proud of what he's achieved. Thank you. I also had the pleasure of speaking with Alec France and Ellie and I have been uh combatants for a number of elections now, but she was successful in Dixon tonight. Uh and she will do a good job as as a local member. Um, she lost her son Henry, which is a tragic circumstance that no parent should ever go through. And equally, I said to to Alan that her son Henry would be incredibly proud of her tonight. And she'll do a good job as a local member for Dixon, and I wish her all the very best. Now, it's been a great honor to be leader of this amazing party for the last three years. And I want to firstly acknowledge uh David Little Proud who has been a great partner in crime. He's led the National Party with great distinction. He's had the strength of character to stand up on issues which are important to us. Uh and we've worked incredibly well together. Uh he's done a great job and he will do into the future. I want to say thank you very much to Susan Lee as my deputy and also Angus Taylor as a shadow treasurer and other senior members who have contributed to uh the success of the last couple of years. I also want to say a very very big thank you tonight most importantly to the millions of Australians who have supported the Liberal Party, the coalition. Uh it's not our night as I point out and there are good members, good candidates who have lost their seats or uh their ambition and I'm sorry for that for that. Uh we have an amazing party and will rebuild. Can I say thank you very much to John Olsen as the president of the party. He's done a fantastic job. Uh to Andrew Hurst and all of the secretariat for for the work that they've done. Uh, I want to say thank you to my staff who are just amazing. Led by Alex Delgle, uh, Jody, Martin, Jackie, Selma, all of the EO staff, uh, my advanced team, uh, the AFP who have done an amazing job for our family and I want to say thank you very much. I have the best media team in the country, uh, led by Nicole Chant and, uh, Adrien Barrett and their team. Uh, they've done an amazing job and I'm so grateful to them. Uh, and to all of our loyal staff. Thank you very much. Uh, that leaves me, of course, with the hardest part, that is my amazing family. Uh, Australians have said, \"Please \nUh I'm blessed to have an amazing family uh in Koli in Beck and Harry and Tom and they uh they've stood by me through thick and thin and uh I'm so grateful for their support and their love. Um, can I say thank you to the people of Dixon and to our amazing supporters in Dixon. Dixon had a one-term curse. It was only ever held for one term at a time and we've held it for 24 years, which is an amazing achievement. 24 years is a long time to be in public life and it has been an amazing honor. But I do want to say thank you to the people of Dixon who have placed faith in me over a long period of time and we've had lots of battles and lots of campaigns. Ultimately, we've been able to deliver an amazing outcome for our local community to residents and people we've been able to help people who were with loved ones who were sick and stranded. uh infrastructure projects. Uh there are many ways in which we've been able to provide amazing support and I want to say thank you very much to them. Our Liberal family is hurting across the country tonight but including in my electorate of Dixon and I want to say thank you very much to all of them. Uh they are amazing people dedicated to their country. Ultimately we live in the best country in the world and I've always believed that. I always will. I love this country and I've fought hard for it. We've been defined by our opponents in this election which is not the true story of who we are. But we'll rebuild from here and we'll do that because we know our values. We know our beliefs and we will always stick to them. I want to say thank you to the Australian people for the faith they placed in me and thank them for the great honor of having been the member for Dixon and the leader of the oppos opposition. Thank you very much. Thank you. Heat.
